CUSTOM jstree (stripping plugins you do not need)
-------------------------------------------------
You can manually remove plugins from the jquery.jstree.js and put that custom file into, as an example, you theme folder and then link to it with the admin settings.

Why?
The base script includes all plugins and is pretty huge. SO if you want to have a smaller file..strip plugins.

Currently Plugins in use
--------------------------------------------------
"plugins":[ "themes", "html_data", "cookies" ]
